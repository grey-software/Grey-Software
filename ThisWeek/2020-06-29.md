## Global Village Software Stack

Inspired by Dr. Marcin Jakubowski's [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/), the [Global Village Software Stack](https://github.com/grey-software/global-village-software-stack) explores the minimally viable stack of software needed to run a sustainable modern civilization.

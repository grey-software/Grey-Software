Toonin poses an interesting problem: How can we allow anyone with a modern device connected to the web to share their audiovisual experiences with others around the world?

### How you can help

**Software Engineers**

Toonin has a solid codebase that could use a refreshing update to Typescript and a useful documentation website.

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue, Quasar, NodeJS, Express, Socket.io, Docker

**Designers**

Toonin received one design iteration on Figma, but has been designed on paper otherwise. The project is ripe for a creative visionary to come in an design a great experience for users.

**Technologies:** We use Figma and Adobe XD to create visual designs and prototypes, but we're open to having you contribute by communicating whatever tool you use to translate your imagination!

**Product Owners**

Toonin is a project with packages for its . For , Toonin's server and web app packages are likely to grow and new ones are likely to be added. To build a truly scalable HD P2P infrastructure, Toonin would benefit from product owners who can use project management tools to execute the vision for Toonin that create with the Designers, Engineers, and Users.  

### Roadmap

The underlying technologies that power Toonin have proven to work, but we haven't created a well-defined vision for how we can use the Toonin infrastructure to do something that would be useful as a part of human life. 

Having such a vision would orient the Toonin team and guide the next phase in this project.

Material Math brings unlimited mental math practice in a fun, beautiful interface to the web!

Material Math is the spiritual successor to Boltz, a mental math app for Android. Grey software is building off of Boltz's great work, and bringing Boltz's principles of unlimited fun math practice, interleaved concepts, and spaced repition to the web!

### How you can help

**Software Engineering**

Material Math has two core developers who are currently working on an MVP based on the Adobe XD Prototype. 

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue, Quasar

**Design**

We want Bolz to be fun for students to use, so there's plenty of room to experiment with designing an educational experience that students pursue with joy.

**Technologies:** We use Figma and Adobe XD to create visual designs and prototypes, but we're open to having you contribute by communicating whatever tool you use to translate your imagination!

### Roadmap

We're trying to get Material Math in the hands of educators so that we can begin collecting feedback and iterating towards a better educational experience.

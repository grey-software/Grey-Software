Grey Software's founder Arsala visited the
[IT Board for Pakistan's AJK province](https://itb.ajk.gov.pk/), and discussed
how the government could adopt open-source best practices to improve their
development operations and invite passionate citizens to contirbute.

## A new org vision

After Arsala's visit to the AJK IT board where he recognized the need for
developing and promoting open-source software in government institutions, we
came up with a new vision for the organization:

_Grey Software is not for profit organization that develops and promotes
open-source software for government and education institutions._

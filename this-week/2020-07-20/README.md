# This week in Grey Software 2020-07-13

We recruited two core team members, and published open analytics for our web apps to explore interesting ethical advertising models.

## Two new core team members ðŸŽ‰

Nina, who has been helping out with Grey Software's general/creative operations, and delivering design and web development work for the [Futurist Network's](https://www.futurist.network) [overhaul](https://xd.adobe.com/view/db524f15-4b15-4fca-6b09-406bf2d42f10-ad63/), **will act as Grey Software's Vice President**!


Milind, who joined Grey Software as an apprentice to develop Material Math, **has graduated to a core software engineer**. Milind will be leading the engineering implementation on futurist.network, Material Math, and the Grey Software website. 

## Open Analytics and Advertising

Grey Software opened web analytics for 4 of its projects to the public [here](/stats) to explore an open advertiser contractor strategy. 

As an advertising relations contractor, you can apply to sell advertising space from Grey Software's apps and websites to ethical, open organizations on behalf of Grey Software. The contract you sign grants you a percentage of all advertising revenue from advertising deals you make.  

## Taking Stock

With 2 more students signed this week, Grey Software now has 8 currently active projects being developed by students for Grey Software, external clients, or themselves.

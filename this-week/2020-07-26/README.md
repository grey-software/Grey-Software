# This week in Grey Software 2020-07-26

## ⚙️ The birth of Grey Khan

Grey Khan watches over Grey Software by automating the organization's operational tasks. Grey started off by creating [an automated weekly team meeting agenda](https://github.com/grey-software/org/issues/39) and creating [daily standup issues](https://github.com/grey-software/Material-Math/issues/51). 

We've setup [a repo](https://github.com/grey-software/automation) to manage and discuss more opportunities for automation.  

## Raising awareness for Grey Software on LinkedIn Focus

We're planning to raise awareness for the cause through advertising the mission on the online real estate afforded to us by LinkedIn Focus, which is [now live and unlisted on the chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkedin-focus/cmafljjdkloacahjddlpaognhjpacdff?hl=en&authuser=2)

## ⚙️ The birth of Grey Khan

Grey Khan watches over Grey Software by automating the organization's operational tasks. Grey started off by creating [an automated weekly team meeting agenda](https://github.com/grey-software/org/issues/39) and creating [daily standup issues](https://github.com/grey-software/Material-Math/issues/51). 

We've setup [a repo](https://github.com/grey-software/automation) to manage and discuss more opportunities for automation.

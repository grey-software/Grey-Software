This week, we officially submitted our articles of incorporation, launched a blog on our website, and began drawing up slides for collaboration models with other organizations. 

## Big Picture Org Stuff

Grey Software officially submitted it's not-for-profit articles of incorporation in Canada under the name **_Canada's Grey Software_**. 

With this, we're able to setup a bank account for the org and connect our Paypal and Stripe accounts to start receiving money from donations and software purchases.

Our web dev portfolio student [Avi](https://github.com/daveavi) built the first prototype of [Twitter Focus](https://github.com/grey-software/Twitter-Focus), a web extension that allows you to hide the feed and What's Happening panel on Twitter so you can focus and control your experience! 

## Blog on grey.software

We integrated the new content feature from Nuxt.js to build a blog on our website. You can check out the blog [here](https://www.grey.software/blog)

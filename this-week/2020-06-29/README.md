# This week in Grey Software 2020-06-29

This is the first iteration of Grey Software's weekly updates on Github! The organization received a new orienting vision, made positive progress across our projects, and established an online presence on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/grey-software) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/grey_software).  

## New orienting vision:

_We're creating the open source ecosystem of the future where software maintainers mentor students and build free software together!_

## Nonprofit Incorporation

We met with [High-Tech U](https://github.com/hightechu)'s [Andrew Maclean](https://github.com/andrewdmaclean) to discuss a pathway to nonprofit incorporation. 

In the coming weeks, we'll be looking for passionate individuals to make up our Organizational Board, our Advisory Board, and our Executive team. 

## Global Village Software Stack

Inspired by Dr. Marcin Jakubowski's [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/), the [Global Village Software Stack](https://github.com/grey-software/global-village-software-stack) explores the minimally viable stack of software needed to run a sustainable modern civilization.

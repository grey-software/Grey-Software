We began laying the foundation for the kind of Discord community that we envision. We're keeping the community small for now, so that we can grow it steadily and maintain a healthy balance between those were seeking help and those who want help.

We recruited BE2200's business model organizer app called [scital](http://scital.app/) to join our collection of open source tools for students. Scital helps students entreprenuers jumpstart their ideas. On the roadmap are features such as links to inspirational blogs and useful business development resources.

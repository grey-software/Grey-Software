## Half a year on Pioneer

This Sunday marks half a year of Grey Software’s participation in the Pioneer global startup tournament, where we’ve recently broken into the Global Top 30 leaderboard. 
During this time, we have had over 20 developers from all over the world successfully contribute code to our projects and have provided an open platform for students to 
gain real-world software experience that they can put on their resumes and online portfolios. We have four actively deployed products, eight external projects, and many more 
open student project ideas in various stages of their incubation.

Toonin poses an interesting problem: How can we allow anyone with a modern device connected to the web to share their audiovisual experiences with others around the world?

### Software Engineers

Toonin has a solid codebase that could use a refreshing update to Typescript and a useful documentation website.

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue, Quasar, NodeJS, Express, Socket.io, Docker

### Designers

Toonin received one design iteration on Figma, but has been designed on paper otherwise. The project is ripe for a creative visionary to come in an design a great experience for users.

**Technologies:** Figma, Adobe XD

### Product Owners

Toonin is a project with packages for its server and web app. For a truly scalable HD P2P infrastructure, these packages are likely to grow and new ones are likely to be added. With that, it's likely that the tasks and team will also grow.

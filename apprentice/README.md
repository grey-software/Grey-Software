# The Grey Software Apprentice Program

The apprentice program offers you the opportunity to learn software development by contributing to open source apps as an engineer, designer, or product manager with guidance and structure from a mentor. 

## The Problem

Formal education doesn't to prepare you for the world's software ecosystem 

Students crave real-world software development experience, because it plays an important role when they’re recruited into the modern tech economy. 

They also need guidance and structure as they gain this experience. 

“Without having the assistance whenever we need it, **we had to spend hours googling** and asking online.” - _Baichen_

“Even though tons of youtube videos are available, **it’s a different experience to have someone that understands what you are going through** to guide you in the project.” - _Shawn_

“As an individual project, you are required to know every aspect of the component including frontend, backend, etc. As a result of that, **for most students...they have a significant knowledge gap to fill**. This preparation process can be time-consuming and discouraging.”  - _Brian_


Outside of highly selective internships, their best bet at getting this kind of experience is by attending expensive bootcamps or taking implementation project courses at school.

## Our Solution

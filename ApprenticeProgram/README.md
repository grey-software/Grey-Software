# The Grey Software Apprentice Program

As an apprentice, you get to contribute as an engineer, designer, or product manager with guidance and structure from a Grey Software mentor!

## The Problem

Students crave real-world software experience, because it plays an important role when they’re recruited into the modern tech economy. 

They also need guidance and structure as they gain this experience. 

Outside of highly selective internships, their best bet at getting this kind of experience is by attending expensive bootcamps or taking implementation project courses at school.

## Our Solution

Grey Software maintains several open-source apps that apprentices can contribute to. By contributing to apps that are relevant in the real world, students can learn how the apps they interact with are built, deployed, and maintained.

You can find our open apprentice projects [here](https://github.com/grey-software/org/blob/master/ApprenticeProjects.md)

### Testimonials

“I have been programming on the side for the past year now, mainly using online resources to pair program... yet one session with my mentor was more enriching than hours spent on these side tutorials.” - [_Osama_](https://github.com/orgs/grey-software/people/OsamaSaleh289)

"I got to experience what it was like being onboarded into a codebase and collaborating with a skilled developer and designer. I got the software development education I was looking for." - [_Milind_](https://github.com/orgs/grey-software/people/milindvishnoi)

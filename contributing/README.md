# Contributing

Learn how to contribute to building the software development ecosystem of the
future!

## What tools will I need?

Access to a computer and reliable internet.

For live software engineering sessions on large projects, you'll need a computer
capable of running VS Code Live Share.

## Do I need to Write Code to Contribute?

Nope! Everyone can contribute!

While software engineers help build Grey Software's apps, we still need support
to:

- Propose and vote on ideas.
- Support the organization's operations
- Write documentation and guides for how to use our apps.

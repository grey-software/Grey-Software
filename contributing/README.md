# Contributing

Learn how to contribute to building the software development ecosystem of the future! 

## What tools will I need?

Access to a computer and reliable internet. 

## Do I need to Write Code to Contribute?
Nope! Everyone can contribute!

While software engineers help build Grey Software's apps, we still need support to:

- Propose and vote on ideas. 
- Support the organization's operations
- Write documentation and guides for how to use our apps.

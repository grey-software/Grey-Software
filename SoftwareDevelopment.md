# Software Development at Grey

As a Grey Software Engineer, you'll often find yourself trying things that don't
work in order to discover what does work.

We understand that there are issues during development that require non-linear,
exploratory work to understand things like:

- How do we go about using the technology available to fix the issue?
- How do we ensure that our changes keep the software usable?
- How do we keep the software in line with its initial mission?

## Project Planning, Deadlines, and Uncertainty

At Grey Software, we use the following tools to manage work:

- Github Milestones to **_define the software's desired state at a particular
  date_**

- Github Projects to **_manage a continuous, prioritized stream of
  value-delivering work_**

- Github Issues to **_describe and prioritize the value-delivering work_**

These tools help us ensure that we have well-defined tasks that are assigned,
and that our shared vision is understood. They help us manage the products and
services we deliver.

## Guiding Principles

We want to deliver software that provides tangible value, and embodies freedom
and excellence. To do this, we're choosing not to follow management models
centered around predictability and efficiency.

We'll keep the following guiding principles in mind:

- Conforming to a schedule is not the same thing as success.

- We are not trying to optimize our ability to estimate tasks.

- Our roadmap does not guarantee success, and requires iteration.

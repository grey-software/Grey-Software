# Code of Conduct 


### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as student contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harmonious experience for everyone by recognizing our common humanity. 

### Our Standards

We hope to foster behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment by:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
